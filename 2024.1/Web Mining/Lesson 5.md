**I. Introduction to Web Mining and Link Analysis**

- This section introduces the concept of web mining and highlights link analysis as a crucial aspect, focusing on its application in understanding relationships and patterns within web data.

**II. Main Problems in Link Analysis**

- **Graph Ranking:** This section defines graph ranking as a method to analyze the importance and influence of nodes within a network structure.
- **Community Detection:** This section introduces the concept of identifying clusters of interconnected nodes within a graph that share similar characteristics or functionalities.
- **Link Prediction:** This section presents link prediction as a technique for forecasting the likelihood of future connections between nodes based on existing network structure and historical data.
- **Graph Classification:** This section outlines the process of categorizing nodes and edges within a graph based on their attributes and relationships.

**III. Graph Ranking in Detail**

- **1.1 Basic Concepts of Graphs:** This section introduces fundamental graph terminology, including directed and undirected graphs, adjacency matrices, and the concept of node degree (in-degree and out-degree).
- **1.2 Dijkstra Algorithm:** This section explains Dijkstra's algorithm, a method for finding the shortest path between a source node and all other nodes in a graph. It details the algorithm's steps and illustrates its application with examples.
- **1.3 Centrality Measures:** This section discusses various centrality measures to assess node importance:
- **Degree Centrality:** Measures node importance based on the number of connections it has.
- **Closeness Centrality:** Measures node importance based on its average distance to all other nodes in the graph.
- **Betweenness Centrality:** Measures node importance based on how frequently it lies on the shortest path between other nodes.
- **1.4 Prestige Measures:** This section explores prestige measures, focusing on:
- **Degree Prestige:** Measures node importance based on the number of incoming links, signifying its influence or authority.
- **Proximity Prestige:** Evaluates node importance based on its proximity and reachability to other important nodes in the network.
- **1.5 PageRank Algorithm:** This section explains the PageRank algorithm, a fundamental algorithm for ranking web pages based on their link structure. It covers the algorithm's formula, iterative process, convergence speed, and applications in web search and citation analysis.
- **1.6 HITS Algorithm:** This section introduces the Hyperlink Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm, another approach for ranking web pages by identifying authoritative and hub pages within a network. It compares HITS with PageRank, details the algorithm's steps, and emphasizes its application in identifying relevant web pages for specific queries.
