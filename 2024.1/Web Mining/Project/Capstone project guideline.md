**I. Project Scope & Topics:**

Suitable topics include:

- **Link Analysis:** Exploring relationships and structures within networks of web pages.
- **Opinion Mining:** Analyzing text data to determine sentiments, opinions, and attitudes.
- **Information Extraction:** Automatically identifying and structuring specific information from web data.
- **Recommendation Systems:** Developing algorithms to suggest relevant items to users based on their preferences and behavior.

**II. Conventional Project Structure:**

The document encourages a traditional research-oriented project structure:

1. **Problem Selection:** Clearly define a specific Web Mining problem (e.g., Sentiment classification).

- Define input data (e.g., sentences) and desired output (e.g., positive/negative classification).

1. **Method Selection:** Choose an appropriate method or set of methods (e.g., SVM).

- Provide strong motivation for the chosen method.
- Thoroughly explain the method's mechanics, including input representation, training process, and prediction generation.

1. **Dataset Selection:** Utilize established benchmark datasets (e.g., imdb) used in prior research.

- Ensure the chosen dataset is readily accessible to the project team.

1. **Implementation:** Develop a working implementation of the chosen method.

- Specify the programming language and libraries used.
- Clearly document any pre-existing code utilized and the modifications made.

1. **Performance Evaluation and Discussion:** Evaluate the implementation using standard metrics (e.g., Precision, Recall, F-score).

- Compare results against relevant baseline models.
- Critically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the chosen method based on the results.

**III. Evaluation Criteria:**

Project evaluation will consider several factors:

- **Adherence to Schedule and Format:** Timely submission and proper formatting of deliverables.
- **Presentation and Q&A:** Clear and informative presentation with insightful responses to questions.
- **Code Quality and Functionality:** Well-structured, documented, and functional code.
- **Teamwork:** Effective collaboration and contribution from all team members.
- **Final Report:** Comprehensive report detailing the project, methodology, results, and analysis.

**IV. Outstanding Project Characteristics:**

Projects demonstrating exceptional depth and innovation are encouraged. These may include:

- **Novel Insights:** Offering new perspectives or improvements to existing methods (e.g., CNNs).
- **New Benchmark Datasets:** Developing valuable new benchmark datasets for the research community.
- **Advanced Methods:** Exploring and applying cutting-edge techniques (e.g., LLMs) or addressing complex problems (e.g., Safety AI).
- **Real-World Applications:** Applying Web Mining techniques to address real-world challenges, such as analyzing document collections related to natural disasters or climate change. **(Note: This approach is considered high-risk and requires significant experience.)**

**V. Emphasis on Understanding:**

The guideline emphasizes the importance of deep understanding throughout the project:

“Basically, you must understand your slide, report, code, data, problem, method.”
