**Answer Key**

1. **Information Retrieval (IR) aims to help users find information within a vast amount of data that best matches their specific information needs.**
2. **A keyword query simply uses a list of words to find matching documents, while a Boolean query utilizes operators like AND, OR, and NOT to create more complex and specific search criteria.**
3. **The Vector Space Model represents both documents and queries as vectors in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a unique term. The weight of each term in the vector represents its importance in the document or query.**
4. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) weighting is used to give more importance to terms that are frequent in a document but rare in the entire collection. This helps to identify terms that are more relevant to the specific document.**
5. **Relevance feedback incorporates user feedback on the relevance of retrieved documents to refine the search query. This iterative process helps to improve the precision and recall of the IR system.**
6. **Pseudo-relevance feedback automatically assumes the top-ranked documents for a given query are relevant. It then extracts terms from these documents to expand the original query and retrieve potentially more relevant documents.**
7. **An inverted index significantly speeds up the search process by creating a data structure that maps each term to a list of documents containing that term. This allows for efficient retrieval of relevant documents without having to scan the entire document collection for each query.**
8. **LSI analyzes the relationships between terms in a collection of documents to identify latent semantic relationships. This helps to retrieve documents that are relevant to a query even if they don't contain the exact same words, but rather synonyms or related terms.**
9. **A meta-search engine aims to improve search coverage and effectiveness by combining and re-ranking results from multiple individual search engines. This allows users to access a broader range of results and potentially find more relevant information.**
10. **Two examples of web spamming techniques are keyword stuffing and link farming. Keyword stuffing involves repeatedly using certain keywords within a webpage's content or meta tags to manipulate search engine rankings. Link farming creates a network of websites that link to each other to artificially inflate the number of backlinks, which is a factor used by search engines to determine a webpage's authority and ranking.**
