# Task 2

***Some people say that the governments should pay for people's health care and education, while others say it is not the government's responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.***

- View 1: economic development (healthier - > contribure more/ only the government ). More educated --> contribute more (reduce social issues - crime)
- View 2:  Personal responsibility->personal benefits/ parents responsibility/ motivation
- Personal View: subsidize --> motivation

**Plan:**
- task 1: 2-3 mins planning --> 10-12 mins writing --> 5 mins checking
- task 2: 5 mins planning --> 20~25 mins writing --> 10 mins checking

									Bài làm
Opinions are divided on whether governments should cover the costs of people's health services and education. I believe that this responsibility should rest with both governments and their citizens.

Supporters of the state paying for people's hostital bills and tuition fees often argue that this initiative would engender economic and social benefits. This is because (*Regarding the former,*) the provision of free health care and education would lead to a healthier and more educated popiulation, which is surely more productive and can consequently act as a catalyst for sustainable economic growth. As for societal benefits, economic prosperity can lead to (*with society becoming more economically prosperous comes*) more job opoportunities and by extension fewer crimes caused by poverty and unemployment.

Despite these benefits, there are those who hold the belief that the onus is not on the government to pay for its population's health care and education. They say that this is a personal responsibility in the sense that people can avoid or alleviate their pain by paying their hospital bills, while paying money to enter certain courses to learn new skills and acquire more academic qualifications renders people more employable. These are all personal benefits, and so it is understandable why some people say that the state should not cover people's health care and education expenses.

Personally, it is ideal that inviduals and governments should shoulder part of these costs. This is because were education and health care to be made free, people might lose the incentive to take care of their health and study diligently given that treating their health problems and failing their courses would not cost them anything. Meanwhile, letting inviduals fend for themselves would not be a good idea either, given all the economic and social advantages for governments to subsidize their citizens' health care and education.

In conclusion, there are legimate/ sensible reasons for and against the idea of governments paying for people's health care and education, but I firmly believe that  such costs  should be  shared by both parties.
