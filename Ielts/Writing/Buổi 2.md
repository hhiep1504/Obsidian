The bar chart illustrate how many boys and girls in the 5-14 age group participated in different/ various cultural activities and sports in Australia in the year 2003.

Overall, girls were more likely than boys to engage in cultural activities, with the exception of playing musical instruments. Additionally, the percentage of boys playing sporting activities was far higher than that of their female counterparts.

Regarding participation in cultural activities, the biggest difference can be seen in the proportions of boys and girls engaging in dancing, which were 2% and 25% respectively. In addition, girls were slightly more likely than boys to partake in drama activities (5% compared to 4%) and singing (also 5% compared to 4%). Finally, playing musical instruments was the only activity whose male participation was higher than that of females, with respective figures of 15% and 10%.

As for sports, proportionally, significantly more boys played sports than girls did. 70% of boys were reported to do sporting activities, compared to just over 50% of girls.





# Task 2

***Individuals  can do nothing  to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extend do you agree or disagree?***


Disagree:
- ONLY governments/large companies - laws --> financial + human resources (large - scale changes) 
Individuals
 - still can --> collective effect/governments (policies) -->  individuals' involvement/ boycott companies that pollute the environment.

There is an opinion that individuals cannot do anything to change the status quo of the environment and that only governments and big corporations can make a real difference. I disagree with this view on both counts when we factor in the collective impact of individuals.  

It does appear that only governments and large businesses can effect noticeable changes to the environment. This is because addressing serious environmental problems usually requires such colossal numbers of financial and human resources that very few incredibly wealthy individuals alone can afford. Furthermore, only the authorities can enact laws and regulations to bring about large- scale changes to the environment, while powerful companies also have the resources needed to do so, for example by subsidizing environmental projects in their areas and by upgrading their waste treatment methods to reduce their environmental impact.  

However, to say that individuals can do nothing to change the environmental for the better is to downplay the impact of their collective effort. Certainly, if only one or a few individuals choose to use electric vehicles or public transport, this cannot effect any discernible change to the problem of air pollution. However, if this effect is multiplied by the millions, it will surely suffice. In addition, the attempt to cleanup a polluted river by a local government will be rendered futile if its citizens continue to discharge waste into said river haphazardly. Finally, individuals also wield the power to boycott companies that pollute the environment to push them towards the direction of sustainability and environmental- friendly practices.

In conclusion, I do believe that individuals can help improve the environment, and this also nulifies the notion that only governments and large companies are the only forces available for this effort.
